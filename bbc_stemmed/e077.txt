dvd review: spider-man 2

it's a univers rule that a film can either be a superhero special effect extravaganza or it can be good. but spider-man 2 break that rule in two.

it's not fantast deep but you get quickli drawn into the tale of spidei versu doc ock and more so into the fate of poor peter parker. gigant action set piec seamlessli work with more brood person torment and it all look stun. a few effect look fals but tobei maguir, kirsten dunst and alfr molina make thi compel. the other univers rule is that dvd of superhero film will have make of featur onli about the effect. thi disc cover those special effect enough but as just on part of a detail look at the film. then there ar commentari, trailer and a blooper reel.

sometim qualiti come in bulk: thi set contain no less than 34 john wayn film rang from the western and war movi to the quiet man.

now is that a christma present or what? give thi to someon on 24 decemb and you won't see them again until earli in the new year. it's not truli a complet collect and lean more toward wayn's earlier film: there's no true grit, for instanc, though there is hellrais. the film look well transfer to dvd, though none ha extra.

it wa veri daft but it knew it wa and somehow thi famou 1979 seri becam a cult favourit that's been long await on dvd. thi set ha the first season of buck (gil gerard) and wilma's (erin grai) tongu-in-cheek adventur and it's all as camp and gaudi as you rememb. but it's also a disappoint. the us dvd ha thi and the more po-face second season - and you can import it for just about the same price. the bigger omiss, though, is that there ar no extra. that's particularli disappoint becaus origin there were meant to be commentari and star gerard and grai had agre to do them.
