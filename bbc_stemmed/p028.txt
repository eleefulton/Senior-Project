a judg should look into the david blunkett controversi as kei question remain unansw, the lib dem sai.

sir alan budd's inquiri link the ex-home secretari to the speed up of a visa claim by hi ex-lover's nanni. but he could not sai whether mr blunkett had treat the nanni as a special case or had us her as an exampl of immigr problem. lib dem spokesman mark oaten said the number of offici who had forgotten what happen wa worri. he told bbc new: "i'm extrem concern that 20 individu appear to have forgotten what happen or more suspici ar not prepar to sai what happen. "that must be bad for govern, it must be bad for public confid in the system."

mr oaten said peopl would be mystifi why sir alan's inquiri fail to uncov why process of the visa applic wa speed up. he said: "there is a strong case for a judg-led judici review of thi becaus, of cours, next time it happen it mai not be about a nanni and their visa. it mai be about someth even more import than that. "so we do need to understand what took place and who wa involv." the tori criticis the lib dem stanc, sai mr oaten had initi said he accept mr blunkett's word unless further evid emerg. but lib dem offici sai mr oaten wa speak when an inquiri wa under wai and wa avoid rush to judgement.
