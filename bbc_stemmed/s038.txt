radcliff prove doubter wrong

thi won't go down as on of the greatest marathon of paula's career. but as a test of charact, it wa the toughest race she's ever taken part in.

a win in the new york marathon doesn't make up for the disappoint of athen in ani shape or form, but it will offer hope and reassur for next year. if paula's last experi of the year had been athen, it would have been veri difficult to look forward with ani optim. she can now draw a line under thi year and make plan about her futur. even if she'd lost thi race, there would have been a lot of posit to take out of it. she know she can dig deep if she need to. it wa a strong field, with a number of the girl go into the race with expect of win. and although two hour 23 minut wasn't on of paula's best time, it wasn't far off the record on a difficult cours.

i wa speak to paula in the lead-up to thi race and she said that in mani wai she wa face a no-win situat. she thought that if she won, peopl would sai "why couldn't she do that in athen?" and if she lost, peopl would sai her career wa over. and a lot of peopl were wonder what would happen if paula wa forc to drop out of thi race, as she did in the marathon and 10,000m in athen. but that wa never on the card. she might have been beaten, but she would have kept run. the reason she wa forc to pull out in athen - the niggl injuri, her lack of energi and the oppress condit - weren't at plai here. the onli question wa what posit she could finish in. most import of all, despit all the hype in the media ahead of thi race, there were never doubt in paula's mind. if she wasn't confid, she wouldn't have run. after all, if you're the best in the world at an event, you'll alwai have expect of win.

now paula will take part in the run london 10km race in london at the end of the year, have a well-earn rest over christma and go into next year with a lot of optim.
