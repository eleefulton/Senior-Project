the origin blinx wa intend to convert mani platform game lover to microsoft's then new xbox consol.

it sharp graphic and novel gameplai, with the main charact abl to paus, slow, rewind and fast-forward time, were meant to lure mani fan to the new machin. but poor design meant the game becam a veri frustrat affair with player often strand half-wai through a level without the requir tool to finish. thankfulli, the sequel ha fix mani of the origin fault. thi time around you do not plai as blinx but instead you ar given the chanc to creat two uniqu cat charact and two pig charact.

the charact gener is veri detail and a few minut of tweak and adjust will creat a uniqu person to unleash on the game.

as the game progress you swap between the two rival faction, pig and felin, assum the role of your creat charact. the thrust of the game see the two faction compet to recov piec of a miss time crystal. as in the origin, your felin persona can control time, but thi time the pig get to control space. there ar a number of puzzl which requir control over time to solv while the pig can creat thing such as warp, space bubbl and void trap in order to progress. the control over space and time is achiev through a number of vcr-style icon and is quit intuit.

annoyingli, the puzzl ar a littl too obvious flag up and most gamer will find it more of a chore than a challeng to solv them. the game ha also tri to emul franchis such as jak and daxter and ratchet and clank on ps2 and so there ar a number of combat element. these ar a littl predict and tend to drag the gener polish of the game down to a more dull affair. but the game's excel graphic, easili the best-look platform game around, sound and dollop of humour make it an attract game for younger platform fan.
