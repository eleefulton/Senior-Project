'brainwav' cap control comput

a team of us research ha shown that control devic with the brain is a step closer.

four peopl, two of them partli paralys wheelchair user, successfulli move a comput cursor while wear a cap with 64 electrod. previou research ha shown that monkei can control a comput with electrod implant into their brain. the new york team report their find in the proceed of the nation academi of scienc. "the result show that peopl can learn to us scalp-record electroencephalogram rhythm to control rapid and accur movement of a cursor in two direct," said jonathan wolpaw and denni mcfarlan. the research team, from new york state depart of health and state univers of new york in albani, said the research wa anoth step toward peopl control wheelchair or other electron devic by thought.

the four peopl face a larg video screen wear a special cap which, meant no surgeri or implant wa need.

brain activ produc electr signal that can be read by electrod. complex algorithm then translat those signal into instruct to direct the comput. such brain activ doe not requir the us of ani nerv of muscl, so peopl with stroke or spinal cord injuri could us the cap effect. "the impress non-invas multidimension control achiev in the present studi suggest that a non-invas brain control interfac could support clinic us oper of a robot arm, a motoris wheelchair or a neuroprosthesi," said the research. the four volunt also show that thei could get better at control the cursor the more time thei tri. although the two partial-paralys peopl perform better overal, the research said thi could be becaus their brain were more us to adapt or that thei were simpli more motiv. it is not the first time research have had thi sort of success in brain-control experi. some team have us ey motion and other record techniqu. earlier thi year, a team at the mit media lab europ demonstr a wireless cap which read brain wave to control a comput charact.
