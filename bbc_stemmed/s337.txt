prop jone readi for hard graft

adam jone sai the wale forward ar determin to set the perfect attack platform for the back by domin the power franc pack in pari.

the prop said: "if we get stuf in the front five our back have had it. "the mental of the french is 'scrum, scrum, scrum'. we will see how good franc ar and the scrum is the kei. "i just hope [the back] carri on where thei left off against itali. it's just up to us in the forward to win the ball and give them the opportun." wale have won two of their last three visit to stade de franc, have secur back-to-back win under graham henri in 1999 and 2001. and with the like of shane william and gavin henson find top form at the right time, mike ruddock's team is now on of intern rugbi's most potent attack threat. "gavin is ridicul talent. he ha been bounc around the place thi week, so he is up for it," warn jone.

franc have been criticis for their uncharacterist on-dimension plai in their victori over scotland and franc. captain fabien pelou ha acknowledg hi side need to show more attack flair, but stress the game with be won or lost up front. the lock believ the welsh forward ar not big enough to troubl hi side in the scrum or line-out, but jone insist hi fellow front-row colleagu have noth to fear.

"gethin [jenkin] won't be intimid tomorrow, none of us will," said jone, who will be face franc for the first time. "we will go out there and front up and hopefulli get the ball out to the back. "me and gethin ar quit young so it is good to have someon of mefin's experi in there. "mefin is a good thinker who put thing across. but what is the sai? if you ar good enough you ar old enough and gethin certainli is. "he is a realli good player and i imagin he will be on the lion tour [to new zealand thi summer]."
