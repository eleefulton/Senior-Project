the chang would all take place within five year of the conserv win a gener elect, mr howard told the paper.

the precis number of mp to go would depend on the result of the welsh referendum, but it would probabl mean a reduct of around 120 from the current total of 659. if wale decid to keep it assembl it would stand to lose more mp. mr howard said as both parti plan to cut the number of civil servant at whitehal - labour by more than 80,000 and the tori by almost 100,000 - thei should accept a similar drop in their own number. "it is all veri well sai govern depart should be reduc, but what about minist, parliament and special advis?" he said. shadow leader of the common oliv heald said: "thi will be part of our aim to reduc unnecessari and costli interfer in peopl's live by reduc the size and role of the state".

mr howard said the plan would also even out the "great unfair" of there be proportion more scottish and welsh mp at westminst than those from england. the averag size of an english constitu wa 70,000 peopl, mr howard said. in northern ireland it wa just over 66,000, in wale just over 59,000 and in scotland 53,000. the number of welsh mp would be set at an amount that wa "consist and fair in term of represent with the rest of the unit kingdom" if the assembl wa scrap. mr howard said the chang should be carri out quickli and could even be implement by the elect after next. "you have got to have a big bang. we don't want thi like the hous of lord reform, get to on stage and then not have the next stage."
