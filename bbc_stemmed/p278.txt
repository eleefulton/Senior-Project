what realli divid the parti

so what is the gap between labour and the tori nowadai?

on starbuck, on ryman and on small greek cafe as it happen. both parti have now complet their move to new headquart, with labour creat it elect hub just three door awai from the tori' new headquart in victoria street, just down the road from the common. that should make thing a littl easier if and when the crack-of-dawn elect press confer kick off. unlik 2001, there should be no need for colleagu to have taxi gun their engin outsid, or to bui scooter, to get themselv between the tightli-timet event.

and, to all intent and purpos, we alreadi appear to be in that gener elect campaign. certainli the press confer host by elect co-ordin alan milburn, in the rather compact new confer room - still smell of new carpet and with the garish new labour coffe mug as yet unstain - had all the hallmark of an elect event.

"welcom to the unremittingli new labour media centr," he said. and i'll bet he hadn't check that on with gordon brown. along with work and pension secretari alan johnson and minist for work jane kennedi, he then went on to tear into the tori plan to scrap the new deal welfar-to-work scheme, which thei claim would lead to an increas of almost 300,000 in unemploy. and thei ridicul the claim made on mondai by michael howard that he could save £35 billion of labour wast and ineffici to spend on public servic while also offer £4 billion of tax cut. labour ha come up with a figur of £22 billion worth of effici save so, understand perhap, believ mr howard must be plan cut to squeez the extra £13 billion. these figur, base on the two parti' own detail studi, will be batter to within an inch of their live dure the campaign. wednesdai wa just the start.
