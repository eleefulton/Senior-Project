the memori drive brown's mission

the memori gordon brown sai keep return to him - the on that he sai is burnt into him - is that of a 12 year-old girl, whose parent di of aid, and who is hiv posit herself.

mr brown seem haunt by her ey, desol of all hope. and then he talk of those ey that do inspir optim: an extraordinari perform by schoolgirl of kenya's largest slum, advanc with crowd menac, flick their hip in a manner almost as disturb, befor the final of a clench fist salut and shout of "free educ - free educ for all". mr brown's messag gener, that compass must becom action befor that hope is squander. but he is such a pivot figur in british polit, it is almost imposs not to ask him why he is do thi. hi answer, in part, is becaus of the missionari that us to come to hi father's church. ever sinc, he sai, africa ha been import to him.

i've absolut no doubt whatsoev thi is heartfelt. but he also believ it is time for the world to see a new gordon brown. not the dull, reassur bank manag but a man driven by a moral passion - and it just so happen the labour parti feel an aw lot happier rid the world of debt than rid the world of dictat.

there's also a sens of liber. if mr blair won't allow him to run the elect campaign then he can at least pretend it wa all get tediou and he'd much rather be out examin social problem in the raw. it also goe some wai to solv on of the overarch problem for all politician of all parti: sceptic slide into cynic about polit itself. if he can help the world's poor just a littl, then it show polit isn't worthless. but is hi vision for africa too grand? can poverti in the contin realli be halv? brown repli that no on thought the berlin wall would ever come down either. he's still got to overcom - not onli the reluct of other financ minist in the world - but also the cynic of expert who wonder whether debt relief will just be squander by govern that just won't in the end spend wise.
