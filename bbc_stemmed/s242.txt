wenger ha brought in manuel almunia for the last three game for the out-of-form jen lehmann - but the spaniard himself ha been prone to mistak. there have been suggest that wenger will swoop for a high-qualiti shot-stopper in the new year. but he told the even standard: "i don't feel it will be necessari to bring in a new goalkeep in januari." the gunner manag refus to comment on the difficult start that 27-year-old almunia ha made to hi career at highburi. and he would not be drawn on whether lehmann would return for the top-of-the tabl clash with chelsea on sundai.

almunia wa at fault for rosenborg's goal in arsen's 5-1 champion leagu win on tuesdai and had some hairi moment in last week's win over birmingham. but wenger said earlier thi week that hi indiffer form wa down to pressur caus by be under scrutini from the media. "the debat ha gone on too long. everyon ha an opinion and i do not have to add to it," wenger ad. arsen have been link with middlesbrough keeper mark schwarzer, fulham's edwin van der sar and parma's sebastien frei. and wenger ha no immedi plan to recal former england under-21 intern stuart taylor from hi loan spell at leicest.
