mci is the us's second-biggest long distanc firm after at&t. consolid in the us telecommun industri ha pick up in the past few month as compani look to cut cost and boost client base. a merger between mci and verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecom deal sinc octob. last week, sbc commun agre to bui it former parent and phone trailblaz at&t for about $16bn. bui mci would give either qwest or verizon access to mci's global network and busi-base subscrib. the rational is similar to the on underpin sbc's at&t deal. verizon is by far the bigger compani and ha it own success mobil arm - factor which mai have swung the board in it favour sinc both suitor ar offer a mixtur of cash and share.
