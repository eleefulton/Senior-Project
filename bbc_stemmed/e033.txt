dvd review: harri potter and the prison of azkaban

thi third harri potter film brought a chang of director and a dramat visual shake-up that realli shine on dvd.

gone ar the warm, bright colour found in the two earlier film, alfonso cuaron bring in a bleak and cold feel that is simpli gorgeou - and look even better here than in the cinema. it is all part of the progress of harri's stori into darker area, but you'll spend time just marvel at the beauti hogwart landscap.

thi is the first potter film where you get so lost in the screen adapt that you forget the book. it is the third year at hogwart and studi ar interrupt, as thei alwai ar, by a calam that onli harri, ron and hermion can put right.

it sound corni. but harri is no longer the winsom hero, he is a moodi teenag and daniel radcliff pull it off veri well. emma watson is ever better as hermion, and the young star ar join by the usual myriad famou actor includ gari oldman and emma thompson. the film itself is the reason to bui thi dvd. but it is laden with behind-the-scene extra, includ funni, if shallow, interview with all the main cast. but what seem like a long list of featur can be swiftli whittl down to the few that you ar go to watch. younger viewer will go for the game which includ a magic you mai have miss memori test, and crookshank chase off after scabber. adult viewer will ignor those and go straight to the delet scene. you will understand why thei were delet but it is fun to see more footag - and not have to hunt through endless menu to find it, as we did on the first harri potter dvd. the most interest piec ar an interview with jk rowl in creat the vision and conjur a scene, a short featurett about the make of the film's big moment.
