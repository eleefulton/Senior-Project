blind student 'hear in colour'

a blind student ha develop softwar that turn colour into music note so that he can read weather map.

victor wong, a graduat student from hong kong studi at cornel univers in new york state, had to read colour map of the upper atmospher as part of hi research. to studi "space weather" mr wong need to explor minut fluctuat in order to creat mathemat model. a number of solut were tri, includ have a colleagu describ the map and attempt to print them in braill. mr wong eventu hit upon the idea of translat individu colour into music, and enlist the help of a comput graphic specialist and anoth student to do the program work.

"the imag have three dimens and i had to find a wai of read them myself," mr wong told the bbc new websit. "for the sake of my own studi - and for the sake of blind scientist gener - i felt it would be good to develop softwar that could help us to read colour imag." he tri a prototyp version of the softwar to explor a photograph of a parrot. in order to have an exact refer to the screen, a pen and tablet devic is us. the softwar then assign on of 88 piano note to individu colour pixel - rang from blue at the lower end of thi scale to red at the upper end. mr wong sai the applic is still veri much in it infanc and is onli us for read imag that have been creat digit. "if i took a random pictur and scan it and then us my softwar to recognis it, it wouldn't work that well."

mr wong ha been blind from the ag of seven and he think that have a "colour memori" make the softwar more us than it would be to a scientist who had never had ani vision. "as the note increas in pitch i know the colour's get redder and redder, and in my mind's ey a patch of red appear." the colour to music softwar ha not yet been made avail commerci, and mr wong believ that sever peopl would have to work togeth to make it viabl. but he hope that on dai it can be develop to give blind peopl access to photograph and other imag.
