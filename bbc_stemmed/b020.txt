call centr user 'lose patienc'

custom try to get through to call centr ar get impati and quicker to hang up, a survei suggest.

onc past the welcom messag, caller on averag hang up after just 65 second of listen to can music. the drop in patienc come as the number of call to call centr is grow at a rate of 20% everi year. "custom ar get us to the idea of an 'alwai avail' societi," sai cara diemont of it firm dimens data, which commiss the survei. howev, call centr also saw a sharp increas of custom simpli abandon call, she sai, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% dure last year. when autom phone messag system ar taken out of the equat, where custom have to pick their wai through multipl option and messag, the number of abandon call is even higher - a sixth of all caller give up rather than wait. on possibl reason for the lack in patienc, ms diemont sai, is the fact that more custom ar call 'on the move' us their mobil phone.

the surg in custom try to get through to call centr is also a reflect of the centr' grow rang of task. "onc a call centr mai have look after mortgag, now it agent mai also be respons for credit card, insur and current account," ms diemont sai. problem ar occur becaus increas respons is not go hand-in-hand with more train, the survei found.

in what dimens data call an "alarm develop", the averag induct time for a call centr worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 dai, leav "agent not equip to deal with custom". thi, ms diemont warn, is "scari" and not good for the bottom line either. poor train frustrat both call centr worker and custom. as a result, call centr have a high "churn rate", with nearli a quarter of worker throw in the towel everi year, which in turn forc compani to pai for train new staff. resolut rate - the number of call where a custom's queri is resolv to mutual satisfact - ar run at just 50%. when the queri is pass on to a second or third person - a specialist or manag - rate rise to about 70%, but that is still well below the industri target of an 85% resolut rate.

suggest that "outsourc" - reloc call centr to low-cost countri like india or south africa - is to blame ar wrong, ms diemont sai.

there ar "no big differ in wait time and call resolut" between call centr base in europ or north america and those in develop countri around the world. "you can make call centr perform anywher if you have good manag and the right process in place," she sai. howev, compani that decid to "offshor" their oper ar driven not just by cost consider. onli 42% of them sai that save monei is the main consider when close domest call centr oper. half of them argu that worker in other countri offer better skill for the monei. but not everybodi believ that outsourc and offshor ar the solut. nearli two-third of all firm poll for the survei have no plan to offshor their call centr. thei give three kei reason for not make the move:

- call centr oper ar part of their busi "core function", 
 - thei ar worri about the risk of go abroad, 
 - thei fear that thei will damag their brand if thei join the offshor drive. the survei wa conduct by sunov on behalf of dimens data, and is base on in-depth questionnair of 166 call centr in 24 countri and five contin. what ar your experi with call centr? ar you happi to listen to vivaldi or greensleev, or do you want an immedi respons? and if you work in a call centr: did your train prepar you for your job?
