the price of the car ha also gone up. when it wa launch, the cheapest mini cost just more than £10,000. these dai, buyer will have to fork out almost £11,500 to own a new mini on, or even more for the cooper s which cost up to £17,730. the mini convert, which wa launch last spring, cost up to £15,690 for the top model, and there is even a wait list. second-hand mini ar not cheap either. a mini on bought when the model wa launch should still fetch at least £8,000 for the cheapest model, while a us cooper s is like to be price from £12,556, accord to the-car bui websit parker's. the consum' associ which oper with slightli differ number, yet it confirm that the mini cooper 1.6 depreci slower than ani other car, other than the merced benz c180 se and the bmw 1 seri 116i se.
