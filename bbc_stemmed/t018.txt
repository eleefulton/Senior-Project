cell could also be market as an ideal technolog for televis and supercomput, and everyth in between, said kevin krewel, the editor in chief of microprocessor report. the chip will be made of sever differ process core that work on task togeth. the playstat 3 is expect in 2006 but develop ar expect to get prototyp earli next year to tune game that will appear on it at launch. detail of the chip will be releas at the intern solid state circuit confer in san francisco. some detail have alreadi emerg, howev. when put insid power comput server, the cell consortium expect it to be capabl of handl 16 trillion float point oper, or calcul, everi second.

the chip ha also been refin to be abl to handl the detail graphic common in game and the data demand of film and broadband media. ibm said it would start produc the chip in earli 2005 at manufactur plant in the us. the first machin off the line us the cell processor will be comput workstat and server. a work version of the ps3 is due to be shown off in mai 2005 but a full launch of the next gener consol is not expect to start until 2006.
