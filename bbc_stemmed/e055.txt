dvd review: i, robot

onli on man recognis that robot ar a threat to human - but that's fine becaus it onli take on man to save the dai in the thriller i, robot.

will smith co-star alongsid more cgi robot than you can count and as a thrill-a-minut kind of action film, it's perfectli adequ. you'll have forgotten it all tomorrow but you'll have a fun night with the film and all the extra. there is a on-disc version that ha commentari and a make of but the two-disc add more. unusu for thi kind of film, the extra don't sole concentr on the special effect. thei're cover but there's also a gener product diari and a post-product featur.

rememb the nation lotteri's draw machin arthur and guinever? thei were more accur than thi glossi hollywood version of the tale.

but as long as you're not expect a documentari, live with it: king arthur is a fun, excit, total shallow experi and look excel. clive owen is the brood king, keira knightli rise abov her costum and rai winston give it all some grit. it's at it best in it battl scene which ar well done and ar also the best part of the make of extra.

less flashi than a david attenborough show and less detail than a simon schama on, the bbc seri british isl nevertheless turn out to be quit engross. admit it, the fact that thi is on of the show alan titchmarsh left ground forc to present did mean that you expect someth equal frothi. but titchmarsh turn out to know hi subject and the sight of our present-dai landscap be peel back to reveal the past wa fascin. he's now written an accompani book, too.
