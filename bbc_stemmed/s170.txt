aragon anger by racism fine

spain coach lui aragon is furiou after be fine by the spanish footbal feder for hi comment about thierri henri.

the 66-year-old criticis hi 3000 euro (£2,060) punish even though it wa far below the maximum penalti. "i am not guilti, nor do i accept be judg for action against the imag of the sport," he said. "i'm not a racist and i've never lack sport decorum. i've never done that and i have medal for sport merit." aragon wa hand the fine on tuesdai after make racist remark about henri to arsen team-mate and spanish intern jose rey last octob.

the spanish footbal feder at first declin to take action against aragon, but wa then request to do so by spain's anti-violenc commiss. the fine wa far less than the expect amount of about £22,000 or even the suspens of hi coach licenc. arsen boss arsen wenger, who wa fine £15,000 in decemb for accus manchest unit striker ruud van nistelrooi of cheat, believ that aragon' punish wa too lenient. "you compar hi fine and my fine, and if you consid hi wa for racist abus, then you seem to get awai with it more in spain than you should," wenger said. "he shouldn't have said what he said, and how much monei is enough, i don't know but it doesn't look a big punish." howev, aragon insist the fine is unjustifi and unfair. "i have been treat like islero (the bull that kill famou bullfight manolet)," said aragon on hear he had been fine for hi action. "i have not like on thing about thi whole affair and i do not agre with the sanction. thei have look for a scapegoat." spain's anti-violenc commiss must now ratifi the spanish fa's decis and ha until next week to announc it verdict. aragon ha 10 dai to appeal, and the commiss can also appeal. alberto flore, presid of the spanish fa's disciplinari committe, said no-on in the committe felt aragon wa a racist nor had "act in a racist wai." "a fine, the highest we could appli, is suffici punish. suspens would have been a bit exagger," flore told sport daili marca.
